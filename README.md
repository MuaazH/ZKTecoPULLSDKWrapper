# ZKTeco PullSDK Wrapper
ZKTeco is a really really bad company. DO NOT BUY ITS DEVICES. THEY ARE JUNK.

  ZKTeco programmers are so BAD. They made an sdk that neither: hides how the device works nor give you full control over the device.
  On top of that, they can't speak english for $#!t. I swear google translate can score better than them combined in the ESL test.
  The end result is a security device that can be hacked with a magnet or a paper clip, a verbose and unencrypted network protocol, incomplete and inconsistent documentation, and an SDK that only runs on windows.
  
# Expert opinion: DO NOT BUY ZKTeco devices
It's just a bad company.

# Why am I supporting their SDK then, am I stupid?
N.. No NOOOO! shut up! your stupid. I mean you're stupid. It did it for a job, Someone had to do the dirty work. It's a victimless crime relative to what ZKTeco did.
